# Astro-Numerology
We are creating a game mixing astrology and numerology. We are asking users their birthdates and when user insert their date, the game will also ask for number input. 
Once both items are input the computer will give you a small preview of your zodiac sign and will also give you a small horoscope with the numerology you input.  
The other game we work on is changing the elements to earth, water, fire, and air signs to correspond with astrology.
